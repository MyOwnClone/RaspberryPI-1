##Template
**This is just a simple Objective-C project template.**   
This is meant to be an empty Objective-C OpenVG/OpenGL shell.
  * **compile:** Compile the app.
  * **crun:** Compile and run the app.
  * **run:** Run the app.

##VGDraw
**This project will see the most active development. I am planning on building an Objective-C wrapper around OpenVG**    
The purpse of this will be to build an easy way to create games and apps based on OpenVG drawing. 
  * **Same commands as the Template**

##GLCube  
**This sample project show the "hello triangle" example running in an objc shell.**  
I am not sure where I am going to go with this. For now it is just like the Template only with a spinning 3-D cube.   
  * **Same commands as the Template**
